## C++ Learning

```size_t``` alias for an unsigned integer type. Able to represent size of an object in bytes.

```typedef``` a different name through which a type can be identified. Any valid datatype can be aliased so that it can be referred to with a different identifier.

```define _USE_MATH_DEFINES``` Used to invoke some custom symbols for mathematical constants.

```#include <algorithm>``` defines a collection of functions especially designed to be used on the ranges of elements.

##### Inline function specifier
keyword ```inline``` Inline function is introduced which is an optimization technique used by the compilers especially to reduce the execution time. The inline functions are a C++ enhancement feature to increase the execution time of a program. Functions can be instructed to compiler to make them inline so that compiler can replace those function definition wherever those are being called. Compiler replaces the definition of inline functions at compile time instead of referring function definition at runtime.\
So does it mean that ```inline``` instructs the compiler to consider the whole function instead of just the function call at the compile time. Yes. Inline means to take the entire function description in the main function while avoiding jumps to the function declaration.
